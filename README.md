# COEN445 Project

Project implements two RSS servers which send updated to clients. The two servers change which is sending the news updated at random intervals. 

## Project Description provided by Professor Khendek:

The Register and Share System (RSS) consists of several clients and two servers. The goal of
the RSS is to allow for users to share information on subjects of interest and remain up to date
on these subjects.

There are two servers, let us name them Server A and Server B, but only one of them is
serving at a time. Both servers are known to the clients (i.e. IP addresses and socket numbers
are known). Initially Server A is serving, but after a random short period of time (5 minutes
for instance) Server A informs all the registered users that it not anymore serving and they
need to talk to the other server. After receiving such a message the users talk to Server B only.
Same thing happens with Server B after a random short period of time, and so on â€¦ Users
always talk to the server currently serving.

When a server decides to not anymore serve, it informs the other server which will take over.
A new user does not know which one is the current server, so it talks to both them, but only
the serving one will answer. Both servers have exactly the same information about the users
and what is going on.

A user has a unique name but where he/she can be reached can change over time. The users
register to the current server, inform the servers of their subjects of interest, send and receive
updates from the current server. A user can update his/her his address (IP address and
Socket#), or subjects of interest anytime. A user will receive updates about his/her subjects of
interest only. A user can deregister, in this case he/she will not publish or receive updates
anymore.
